# AniGAN---Generating-faces-in-the-style-of-japanese-animation

This is my first project using Keras and I decided to create a General Adversarial Neural Networks for generating anime faces. In the code, I have provided scripts both for scraping images from myanimelist.net and cropping faces in these images. I will not include the created dataset, since I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to do so.

Results of the trained GAN are satisfying - after only 50 epochs, the generator model returns images of faces resembling anime characters. The GIF of generated images after every epoch is presented below:
